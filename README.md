Mobile app for the University of Portsmouth

This repository is the source for the phonegap app built for the University of Portsmouth as part of my Final Year Engineering Project.
This repository is pulled to Phonegap Build where it is converted into an apk for Android Devices and also an xap for Windows Mobile Devices.
