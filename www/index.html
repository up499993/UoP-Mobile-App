					   <h3>Academic Skills Unit</h3>
					   <p>The Academic Skills Unit (ASK) can help you to understand and develop your thinking, writing and organisational skills through confidential tuition, workshops and a wide range of handouts and resources.</p>
					   <p>ASK can be found on the Third Floor of The Nuffield Centre or can be contacted on +44 (0)23 9284 3028 or <a href="mailto:academicskills@port.ac.uk" title="academicskills@port.ac.uk">academicskills@port.ac.uk</a></p>
					   <h4>Opening Times</h4>
					   <p>Monday - Thursday: 8:30am - 5.00pm<br />Fridays: 8.30am - 4.00pm</p>
					   <h4>What We Offer</h4>
					   <p>
								
						<div data-role="collapsible-set">
							<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
							   <h3>One-to-one tuition</h3>
							   <p>Confidential tuition personalised for all campus-based or distance learners, with evening sessions available.</p>
							   <p> Our friendly, non-judgmental and highly experienced lecturers offer confidential tuition that is personalised for each individual student. Through discussion and reflection on previous academic work, we help students:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>improve their understanding of the kinds of thinking and writing that foster success</li>
									<li>discover practical steps for improving academic performance</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Students may refer themselves to ASK (though they may be recommended to do so by a subject lecturer or personal tutor). For campus-based students, tutorials are typically one hour long and are held in the ASK offices in the Nuffield Centre. The number of tutorials and precise focus will vary according to need and are always negotiated and agreed with the student.</p>
								<p>Distance-learning students may be supported by telephone, e-mail or other software, as agreed by the tutor and student once initial contact has been made.</p>
								<p>Evening tutorials are offered between 5pm and 7pm on most Wednesday evenings in term time.</p>
							</div>
							<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
							   <h3>Resources</h3>
							   <p>
							   You can have access to a wide selection of resources including an online study skills resource, as well as a variety of handouts available in hard copy at the Nuffield Centre, the University Library and other locations around the campus.  Handouts can also be downloaded from the Academic Skills Unit website <a href="http://port.ac.uk/students/academic-skills-unit/resources/" title="Academic Skills Unit - Resources">here</a>.
							   </p>
							   <h4>Online Resources</h4>
							   <p>Skills4Study Campus from Palgrave Macmillan is the University of Portsmouth's online study skills resource. Its modules cover all of your essential study skills needs. You can access it from the Moodle course '<a href="http://moodle.port.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=3155" title="skills@portsmouth Moodle Site">skills@portsmouth</a>'.</[>
							</div>
							<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
							   <h3>Workshops</h3>
							   <p>We offer an extensive programme of workshops, each of which addresses a particular theme or skill. Our experienced lecturers use a mix of teaching, discussion and activity to develop your understanding and skills.</p>
							   <p>Students who have attended these workshops have commented on the 'approachable tutors', 'excellent delivery' and 'useful insight' that 'really made me think' and 'made me feel like I can gain marks'.</p>
							   <p>It is a great way to tackle any study-related issues and brush up on your academic skills to hopefully gain the results you wish to achieve.</p>

					<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
					   <h3>Additional Support and Disability Advice Centre</h3>
					   <p>The Additional Support and Disability Advice Centre (ASDAC) can provide advice and arrange support for all University of Portsmouth disabled students and applicants</p>
					   <h4>Information for students</h4>
					   <p>Here are some of the support and advice services that we offer to make your University experience as smooth as possible:
					   <ul>
						<li>Confidential advice from disability professionals</li>
						<li>Advice on funding to cover disability-related support costs (including disabled students' allowances)</li>
						<li>Discussion and agreement on appropriate reasonable adjustments</li>
						<li>Associated University services and facilities</li>
						<li>Arranging note-taking, mentoring and other academic support services</li>
						<li>Specialist study skills tuition and assistive technology training</li>
						<li>Screening for suspected Specific Learning Difficulties</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<h4>Examination and assessment procedures</h4>
						<p>The University's assessment procedures have been developed to avoid, as far as possible, placing you at a disadvantage. Where appropriate and where possible, further specific provision will be made to ensure that you are given every reasonable opportunity, fairly, to demonstrate your abilities. The necessary procedures are managed by ASDAC who have responsibility for seeing that all necessary adjustments are implemented.</p>
						<div data-role="collapsible-set" data-mini="true">
							<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
							   <h3>Adjustments</h3>
							   <p>Adjustments apply to all processes associated with both examinations and in-class tests and can include extra time, special seating arrangements, the provision of separate rooms, word processing facilities, amanuensis, rest breaks, hand-held spell checkers and alternative methods of assessment. However, they do not apply to the outcomes of the assessments themselves.</p>
							   <p>Study skills support for examination and coursework is also provided, with the emphasis on enabling you to address the assessment challenge yourself rather than doing parts of it for you. Thus, for example, techniques for effective proofreading using assistive software are provided, but proofreading itself is not offered as a support service.</p>
							   <p>In general, our intention is to put support arrangements in place, make 'reasonable adjustments' to the assessment processes (such as additional time in examinations or alternative but equivalent methods of assessment) and then mark all students equally based on the academic standards of the course. This will encourage you to develop personal coping strategies instead of providing ‘sympathetic’ marking and deadline arrangements, which could mislead you and your potential employer as to the integrity of your achievements and also compromise academic standards generally.</p>
							</div>
							<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
							   <h3>Evidence</h3>
							   <p>In all cases, evidence of disability will be required before any adjustments can be granted. In most cases a ‌doctor's or consultant's letter confirming the presence of the disability and the nature of the difficulties it causes will be sufficient.</p>
							   <p>However in the case of students with specific learning difficulties (e.g. dyslexia) a Post-aged sixteen assessment by an appropriately qualified professional will be required. ASDAC may be able to arrange such an assessment at pre-arranged times but please bear in mind that it takes several weeks to arrange an appointment, so disclosure of your needs at the earliest possible opportunity is essential.</p>

					   <h3>Counselling and Well-being Services</h3>
					   <p>The University's Counselling and Well-being Service provides confidential help for all students at the University.</p>
					   <h4>Considering Counselling?</h4>
					   <p>Maybe you are having difficulties with a personal issue, under pressure with your academic work or perhaps you are an international student finding it hard to settle into university life in a new country. Whatever the problem, our counselling team can offer you confidential help and guidance.</p>
					   <p>We offer confidential help with a wide range of personal and emotional concerns, available to every student at this University free of charge. All kinds of students find their way to us from all over the University and for all sorts of reasons. If you are experiencing difficulties, it is important to think about what kind of help you need.</p>
					   <p>Along with face-to-face counselling support, we offer a range of other services depending on your preferred mode and level of help:</p>
					   <div data-role="collapsible-set" data-mini="true">
							<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
								<h3>Immediate help in a crisis</h3>
								<p>We know that there are times when things can seem urgent, or you are in a crisis. If you need to talk to a counsellor the same day, we will make every effort to meet with you briefly or at least phone you – you can ask our administrator, Helen, on (023) 9284 3466 to try and arrange this.</p>
								<p>As the University Counselling and Wellbeing Service is not primarily an emergency service, counsellors are normally available by making an appointment, which can easily be done by contacting us.</p>
							</div>
							<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
								<h3>Mental health advice</h3>
								<p>We all experience fluctuations in both our physical and mental health, and some sources suggest that approximately 1 in 4 of us experience a mental health difficulty at some point in our lives.</p>
								<p>University life can be both exciting and challenging and students may feel concerned about their mental health at times. Difficulties can often be resolved with lifestyle changes and support from friends and family but, for those with longer term problems, additional help from the University or other services can help them manage symptoms and stay well.</p>
								<p>The University is committed to providing a positive learning environment for students with mental health needs. The Mental Health Coordinator, Pam Ringland, can provide advice, information and support to help lessen the impact of mental health difficulties so that students can get the best from University life.</p>
							</div>
							<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
								<h3>E-counselling</h3>
								<p>Email counselling follows the same fundamental principles as face-to-face counselling but uses a different medium. It provides you with an opportunity to explore personal issues in a private setting with a counsellor who will work with you to understand what you are experiencing and perhaps help you to consider any changes you may wish to make. Instead of a weekly face-to-face appointment in the counsellor's room, a weekly email is exchanged between counsellor and client.</p>
								<p>Once you express an interest in email counselling, you will be asked to complete some forms.  This is in order to provide some personal data and to give some initial information about yourself which will assist your counsellor in assessing the suitablility of this approach for you. Alternatively, you can meet with a counsellor for a face-to-face assessment. If email counselling is not advised, other options can be explored at this point. You will also need to read and agree to the policy concerning email counselling.</p>
								<p>Once counselling is agreed, your counsellor will let you know which day he or she will be responding to your weekly email, which will need to be sent at least 24 hours in advance of this day. Other guidelines will be discussed at this point too. We will then ask you to fill in a brief, standard questionnaire before each session to let us know how you are. The information is a valuable way for you and the counsellor to keep track of how things are going together and make the most of the sessions. How or whether you answer the questionnaire will not limit your access to the service in any way.</p>

							<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
								<h3>Self-help resources</h3>
								<p>A wide range of self-help resources and information are available on our website <a href="http://www.port.ac.uk/students/counselling-and-wellbeing-service/self-help-and-other-resources/" title="Counsellins and Wellbeing Service - Self-help resources">www.port.ac.uk/counselling</a> </p>
							</div>
							<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
								<h3>Workshops and courses</h3>
								<p>Throughout the academic year, we run a range of one-off workshops and longer courses for students (please note that the programme is not available to university staff). These can be excellent ways of getting help with commonly experienced difficulties.</p>
								<p>Each course and workshop has been designed to cover topics that are relevant for the students here at Portsmouth – please click on the links below to learn more about any that might be of interest to you.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>Coming to counselling is about making the positive choice that you believe counselling is the kind of help you would most benefit from. You do not have to be in crisis to come to counselling – you may just be feeling unhappy or confused, and feel you would like to talk about this. Of course, if you are in crisis, the service will provide help, although if you need to talk to someone urgently, or you need emergency medical or psychiatric help, another service may be more appropriate.</p>
