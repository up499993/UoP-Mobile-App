					   <h3>Academic Skills Unit</h3>
					   <p>The Academic Skills Unit (ASK) can help you to understand and develop your thinking, writing and organisational skills through confidential tuition, workshops and a wide range of handouts and resources.</p>
					   <p>ASK can be found on the Third Floor of The Nuffield Centre or can be contacted on +44 (0)23 9284 3028 or <a href="mailto:academicskills@port.ac.uk" title="academicskills@port.ac.uk">academicskills@port.ac.uk</a></p>
					   <h4>Opening Times</h4>
					   <p>Monday - Thursday: 8:30am - 5.00pm<br />Fridays: 8.30am - 4.00pm</p>
					   <h4>What We Offer</h4>
					   <p>
								
						<div data-role="collapsible-set">
							<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
							   <h3>One-to-one tuition</h3>
							   <p>Confidential tuition personalised for all campus-based or distance learners, with evening sessions available.</p>
							   <p> Our friendly, non-judgmental and highly experienced lecturers offer confidential tuition that is personalised for each individual student. Through discussion and reflection on previous academic work, we help students:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>improve their understanding of the kinds of thinking and writing that foster success</li>
									<li>discover practical steps for improving academic performance</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Students may refer themselves to ASK (though they may be recommended to do so by a subject lecturer or personal tutor). For campus-based students, tutorials are typically one hour long and are held in the ASK offices in the Nuffield Centre. The number of tutorials and precise focus will vary according to need and are always negotiated and agreed with the student.</p>
								<p>Distance-learning students may be supported by telephone, e-mail or other software, as agreed by the tutor and student once initial contact has been made.</p>
								<p>Evening tutorials are offered between 5pm and 7pm on most Wednesday evenings in term time.</p>
							</div>
							<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
							   <h3>Resources</h3>
							   <p>
							   You can have access to a wide selection of resources including an online study skills resource, as well as a variety of handouts available in hard copy at the Nuffield Centre, the University Library and other locations around the campus.  Handouts can also be downloaded from the Academic Skills Unit website <a href="http://port.ac.uk/students/academic-skills-unit/resources/" title="Academic Skills Unit - Resources">here</a>.
							   </p>
							   <h4>Online Resources</h4>
							   <p>Skills4Study Campus from Palgrave Macmillan is the University of Portsmouth's online study skills resource. Its modules cover all of your essential study skills needs. You can access it from the Moodle course '<a href="http://moodle.port.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=3155" title="skills@portsmouth Moodle Site">skills@portsmouth</a>'.</[>
							</div>
							<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
							   <h3>Workshops</h3>
							   <p>We offer an extensive programme of workshops, each of which addresses a particular theme or skill. Our experienced lecturers use a mix of teaching, discussion and activity to develop your understanding and skills.</p>
							   <p>Students who have attended these workshops have commented on the 'approachable tutors', 'excellent delivery' and 'useful insight' that 'really made me think' and 'made me feel like I can gain marks'.</p>
							   <p>It is a great way to tackle any study-related issues and brush up on your academic skills to hopefully gain the results you wish to achieve.</p>

					<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
					   <h3>Additional Support and Disability Advice Centre</h3>
					   <p>The Additional Support and Disability Advice Centre (ASDAC) can provide advice and arrange support for all University of Portsmouth disabled students and applicants</p>
					   <h4>Information for students</h4>
					   <p>Here are some of the support and advice services that we offer to make your University experience as smooth as possible:
					   <ul>
						<li>Confidential advice from disability professionals</li>
						<li>Advice on funding to cover disability-related support costs (including disabled students' allowances)</li>
						<li>Discussion and agreement on appropriate reasonable adjustments</li>
						<li>Associated University services and facilities</li>
						<li>Arranging note-taking, mentoring and other academic support services</li>
						<li>Specialist study skills tuition and assistive technology training</li>
						<li>Screening for suspected Specific Learning Difficulties</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<h4>Examination and assessment procedures</h4>
						<p>The University's assessment procedures have been developed to avoid, as far as possible, placing you at a disadvantage. Where appropriate and where possible, further specific provision will be made to ensure that you are given every reasonable opportunity, fairly, to demonstrate your abilities. The necessary procedures are managed by ASDAC who have responsibility for seeing that all necessary adjustments are implemented.</p>
						<div data-role="collapsible-set" data-mini="true">
							<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
							   <h3>Adjustments</h3>
							   <p>Adjustments apply to all processes associated with both examinations and in-class tests and can include extra time, special seating arrangements, the provision of separate rooms, word processing facilities, amanuensis, rest breaks, hand-held spell checkers and alternative methods of assessment. However, they do not apply to the outcomes of the assessments themselves.</p>
							   <p>Study skills support for examination and coursework is also provided, with the emphasis on enabling you to address the assessment challenge yourself rather than doing parts of it for you. Thus, for example, techniques for effective proofreading using assistive software are provided, but proofreading itself is not offered as a support service.</p>
							   <p>In general, our intention is to put support arrangements in place, make 'reasonable adjustments' to the assessment processes (such as additional time in examinations or alternative but equivalent methods of assessment) and then mark all students equally based on the academic standards of the course. This will encourage you to develop personal coping strategies instead of providing ‘sympathetic’ marking and deadline arrangements, which could mislead you and your potential employer as to the integrity of your achievements and also compromise academic standards generally.</p>
							</div>
							<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
							   <h3>Evidence</h3>
							   <p>In all cases, evidence of disability will be required before any adjustments can be granted. In most cases a ‌doctor's or consultant's letter confirming the presence of the disability and the nature of the difficulties it causes will be sufficient.</p>
							   <p>However in the case of students with specific learning difficulties (e.g. dyslexia) a Post-aged sixteen assessment by an appropriately qualified professional will be required. ASDAC may be able to arrange such an assessment at pre-arranged times but please bear in mind that it takes several weeks to arrange an appointment, so disclosure of your needs at the earliest possible opportunity is essential.</p>

					   <ul>
						<li>listen to you non-judgementally</li>

						<li>encourage development and nurture growth</li>

					   <h3>Clubs and Societies</h3>
					   <p>Societies support students who want to participate in a range of activities, whether it be performing arts, social, religious, cultural, political or academic. Societies are part of the Union's dedication to providing students with an inclusive and diverse community whilst also providing some of the most exciting and unique activities available.</p>
					   <p>There are a huge range of different societies to get involved with, so to help you understand, we’ve broken them down into the following categories:</p>
					   <div data-role="collapsible-set" data-mini="true">
						<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
							<h3>Physical Activities</h3>
							<p>If it’s a sense of adventure you’re after, or you simply like to keep fit, develop some skills and have lots of fun then taking part in a physical activity could be just for you! Physical activities strive to accommodate people of all abilities and exist primarily for recreation not competition.</p>
						</div>
						<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
							<h3>Faith</h3>
							<p>Passionate about your beliefs? Take part in or witness the experience offered by our vibrant community of faith societies. Our faith based societies are for believers and nonbelievers alike. Read the bible but still not sure? Tried the Koran and not convinced? We will be running debates throughout the year that will put religion into the spotlight so you can discuss its main themes and make up your own mind.</p>
						</div>
						<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
							<h3>Cultural</h3>
							<p>If you’re missing a slice of home and feel like you want to relish in your culture then joining a cultural society is for you! From traditional music to home cooked meals there’s an extended family in Portsmouth waiting for you. We guarantee you won’t feel alienated as Cultural Societies exist for you to meet people that understand you and willing to share their experience and knowledge about where to go and what to do at University. You don’t have to be African to join the African-Caribbean society or LGBT to join our LGBT society; all our cultural societies are welcoming so that you can feel comfortable about learning about other cultures and lifestyles.</p>
						</div>
						<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
							<h3>Political</h3>
							<p>You’ve heard it all before, but it’s true, University is the place where you’ll discover what you really believe. Our political societies cover most of the political spectrum, so if you want to get involved with campaigns to eliminate extreme poverty, save the environment or right some wrongs then these communities exist to support you. We will be running debates through our Political Union, so that all students can discuss issues they are passionate about and come away feeling they have learnt something new.</p>
						</div>
						<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
							<h3>Common Interest</h3>
							<p>Our Common Interest societies allow you to meet people who share the hobbies you’re passionate about. It could be a particular style of music you enjoy practicing with others, or a love of film you’d like to share with the student community. Our common interest societies are incredibly diverse, and if you can’t find one that represents a hobby you’re passionate about then it’s incredibly easy to start up your own!</p>
						</div>
						<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
							<h3>Academic</h3>
							<p>Being part of an academic society is a fantastic way to gain the most from your studies, but that’s not all they offer, it’s a brilliant way to network with people at all levels of your course. The atmosphere is one where you can share ideas and thoughts on your work, go on field trips not offered by your course, or even lobby the University on issues you are unhappy about. There’s no doubt that joining an academic society will be beneficial to your CV and allow you to see your course from a new angle.</p>

					  <p>The Societies Constitution is the core rulebook that societies follow. If you need to know how to do something, what a society should be doing throughout the year or how to resolve a dispute, then the constitution is the document you should check.</p>
					  <p>Societies may have their own constitutions, but the main Societies Constitution takes precedence. The Societies Constitution is however below the Unions core bylaws which detail the running of the entire organisation.</p>
					  <h4>Societies Kit</h4>
					  <p>Union societies are able to have customised kit made featuring the University crest. This is exclusively available through the Union Welcome Centre.</p>
					  <p>Prices start at &pound;25 for a crested Polo Shirt and &pound;35 for a Hoody.</p>
					  <p>No one else is licensed to produce the crest and this exclusive to the Union Welcome Centre.</p>
					  <p class="bold">Group Buying</p>
					  <p>If your group wants to get together an put in a bulk order of 20 or more items we’re please to be able to offer an additional 10% off your order. Pop in to the Union Shop to complete a form with your order.</p>
					  <p class="bold">Customisation</p>
					  <p>if you’d like to put a society logo on your items rather than just text printed across your back you’ll need to pay a one-off &pound;20 fee (per colour) to set up the screen print system and an then it’ll cost just &pound;34 per hoody and &pound;24 per polo. This is only available to bulk purchases over 20 items.</p>
					  <p>If you’ve got any queries please speak to someone in the Union Shop.</p>

							<div data-role="collapsible-set" data-mini="true">
								<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
									<h3>Your Print Account</h3>
									<p>Every student is given £10 when they start at the University, and then before the start of each academic year for use with students printers. Print charges are clearly displayed in printer areas and the appropriate amount deducted from your account once the item has been printed.</p>
									<p>You can top up your account on line at <a href="http://myprint.port.ac.uk" title="My Printing Account">myprint.port.ac.uk</a>, by cash in the Library Computer suite or by purchasing a top up card at one of the University's many catering establishments. </p>
								</div>
								<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
									<h3>Printing</h3>
									<p>The University student printers use a system called Pull-Printing. Your print is held in a queue until you swipe your student card over the card reader on the printer which releases your prints to that printer. This will print everything you have waiting in the queue, so be sure to cancel any prints you do not want at <a href="http://myprint.port.ac.uk" title="My Printing Account">myprint.port.ac.uk</a> under jobs pending release. You must also make sure you have enough credit to print all you have in the queue, or else it will not be released.</p>
									<p>You can release your prints on ANY student printer across campus, which has a card reader, so long as it was sent to either the Student-B&W or Student-Colour queues, no matter where you sent the print from.</p>
									<p class="bold">What If I don't have my card or my card doesn't work?</p>
									<p>You can still print even if you do not have your card or if there is a problem with your card. Login to myprint.port.ac.uk and select Jobs Pending Release, this is where you can also cancel unwanted prints. Next to the item you require, click Print. A long list of print queues will appear, select the one which you want to send your print to.</p>
									<p>Alternatively you can go to an IT Helper at one of the IT Help desks in our Open Access Suites and they can release the print for you.</p>

									<h3>Large Format Printing</h3>
									<p>To print to the Large Format printers, you will need to chose the queue 'student-large-format', which is an option on all students PCs. You then need to visit an IT Helper in the Library IT Suite, and they will then release your Large Format printing</p>
									<p>The Large Format Printing Service is based in several locations throughout the university.</p>
									<p>The cost of printing is significantly cheaper than external companies and is ideal for producing posters, banners, signage, architectural plans and technical drawings.</p>

					   <h3>Counselling and Well-being Services</h3>
					   <p>The University's Counselling and Well-being Service provides confidential help for all students at the University.</p>
					   <h4>Considering Counselling?</h4>
					   <p>Maybe you are having difficulties with a personal issue, under pressure with your academic work or perhaps you are an international student finding it hard to settle into university life in a new country. Whatever the problem, our counselling team can offer you confidential help and guidance.</p>
					   <p>We offer confidential help with a wide range of personal and emotional concerns, available to every student at this University free of charge. All kinds of students find their way to us from all over the University and for all sorts of reasons. If you are experiencing difficulties, it is important to think about what kind of help you need.</p>
					   <p>Along with face-to-face counselling support, we offer a range of other services depending on your preferred mode and level of help:</p>
					   <div data-role="collapsible-set" data-mini="true">
							<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
								<h3>Immediate help in a crisis</h3>
								<p>We know that there are times when things can seem urgent, or you are in a crisis. If you need to talk to a counsellor the same day, we will make every effort to meet with you briefly or at least phone you – you can ask our administrator, Helen, on (023) 9284 3466 to try and arrange this.</p>
								<p>As the University Counselling and Wellbeing Service is not primarily an emergency service, counsellors are normally available by making an appointment, which can easily be done by contacting us.</p>
							</div>
							<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
								<h3>Mental health advice</h3>
								<p>We all experience fluctuations in both our physical and mental health, and some sources suggest that approximately 1 in 4 of us experience a mental health difficulty at some point in our lives.</p>
								<p>University life can be both exciting and challenging and students may feel concerned about their mental health at times. Difficulties can often be resolved with lifestyle changes and support from friends and family but, for those with longer term problems, additional help from the University or other services can help them manage symptoms and stay well.</p>
								<p>The University is committed to providing a positive learning environment for students with mental health needs. The Mental Health Coordinator, Pam Ringland, can provide advice, information and support to help lessen the impact of mental health difficulties so that students can get the best from University life.</p>
							</div>
							<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
								<h3>E-counselling</h3>
								<p>Email counselling follows the same fundamental principles as face-to-face counselling but uses a different medium. It provides you with an opportunity to explore personal issues in a private setting with a counsellor who will work with you to understand what you are experiencing and perhaps help you to consider any changes you may wish to make. Instead of a weekly face-to-face appointment in the counsellor's room, a weekly email is exchanged between counsellor and client.</p>
								<p>Once you express an interest in email counselling, you will be asked to complete some forms.  This is in order to provide some personal data and to give some initial information about yourself which will assist your counsellor in assessing the suitablility of this approach for you. Alternatively, you can meet with a counsellor for a face-to-face assessment. If email counselling is not advised, other options can be explored at this point. You will also need to read and agree to the policy concerning email counselling.</p>
								<p>Once counselling is agreed, your counsellor will let you know which day he or she will be responding to your weekly email, which will need to be sent at least 24 hours in advance of this day. Other guidelines will be discussed at this point too. We will then ask you to fill in a brief, standard questionnaire before each session to let us know how you are. The information is a valuable way for you and the counsellor to keep track of how things are going together and make the most of the sessions. How or whether you answer the questionnaire will not limit your access to the service in any way.</p>

								<h3>Self-help resources</h3>
								<p>A wide range of self-help resources and information are available on our website <a href="http://www.port.ac.uk/students/counselling-and-wellbeing-service/self-help-and-other-resources/" title="Counsellins and Wellbeing Service - Self-help resources">www.port.ac.uk/counselling</a> </p>
							</div>
							<div data-role="collapsible" data-mini="true">
								<h3>Workshops and courses</h3>
								<p>Throughout the academic year, we run a range of one-off workshops and longer courses for students (please note that the programme is not available to university staff). These can be excellent ways of getting help with commonly experienced difficulties.</p>
								<p>Each course and workshop has been designed to cover topics that are relevant for the students here at Portsmouth – please click on the links below to learn more about any that might be of interest to you.</p>

						<p>Coming to counselling is about making the positive choice that you believe counselling is the kind of help you would most benefit from. You do not have to be in crisis to come to counselling – you may just be feeling unhappy or confused, and feel you would like to talk about this. Of course, if you are in crisis, the service will provide help, although if you need to talk to someone urgently, or you need emergency medical or psychiatric help, another service may be more appropriate.</p>
